# Exercises
Penetration testing exercise using metasploit on Glassfish. The exercise
targets the Glassfish application server running under Windows in the metas-
ploitable~3 image. The test is performed via a brute force attack against the
login page.

In this exercise we need the Kali machine (for penetration testing) and the vulnerable
machine is the Metasploitable3 Windows image. It is the only exercise to be performed
against the Windows image and the last metasploitable exercise of the course.

Please note that all questions (full lines) marked with †should be answered in the report
which you submit as assignment 2. Note on the length of answers: Questions which are
described as discussion or open target an appropriate level of elaboration as you see fit,
whereas the other questions can typically be answered with a sentence. Nonetheless,
there are no length requirements on the answers.

While scanning for vulnernable services in Exercise~03, Glassfish running on port 4848
should have come up.
